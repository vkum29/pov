> **M**odel **V**iew **C**ontroller is a framework which separates data logic from presentation logic and business logic of application.

## Pros

* Fast! Use of Virtual DOM to compare current view with modified view (after user interaction) to find what requires repainting.
* Reusable! Component focused development.
* Uni directional data flow.
* Easy and performing coding with <a href='./../jsx/readme.md'>JSX</a>.

> **JSX** gets converted to optimal JavaScript code resulting in performing code.

* One programing library for mobile and desktop application
* SEO Friendly! React can be run on server and virtual DOM is rendered as normal web page on client.

## Cons

* Complex to write with pure JavaScript and html
* Insufficient in alone as it serves view requires other libraries to complete application architecture.
