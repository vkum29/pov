# <a href='./../readme.md'>POV</a> > TypeScript

Is a superscript of javascript created to overcome challenge of duck type languages by adding ways to specify data type.

It is transpiled into javascript as it is not natively supported by browsers.

Also the other features provided by typescript is ES6 and ES7 features in advance.

## Features
- Using Static and custom type instead of dynamic variable
- Type casting
- abstract classes
- Interface
- New ECMAScript features like decorators, class, modules(import,export) etc.

## Pros
- More declarative and expressive coding practice
- Makes coding more manageable and easy

## Cons
- File gets compiled/transpiled even though we have typescript errors
- And as at browser we have generated javascript and not actual typescript code we wrote all static type declaration are removed as javascript is dynamic. So if someone is looking at

## What we need to use it
- A text editor
- Typescript compiler
- And a execution environment(like Node or Browsers)

## To be in action
Use online editor
  <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html">use typescript playground</a>

Or you can clone this simple setup
- clone <a href="https://github.com/vkum29/typescript.git">hands on typescript</a>
- Do npm install to resolve dependencies
- Use npm run dev to convert and watch for any changes in *.ts files*
- Or npm start to convert them once.
